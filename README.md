# ConceptAlignment

Library under development for the DARPA WorldModelers program.

This library is intended to be used to align concepts from a top-down
program ontology to bottom-up concepts/indicators/variables/model components.

The REST API is served from http://linking.cs.arizona.edu which provides
access to the [OpenAPI documentation](http://linking.cs.arizona.edu/assets/openapi/webapp.yaml).
