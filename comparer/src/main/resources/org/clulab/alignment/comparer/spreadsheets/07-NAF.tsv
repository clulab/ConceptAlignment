For example, the Indicator looks at patterns of progressive economic decline of the society as a whole as measured by per capita income, Gross National Product, unemployment rates, inflation, productivity, debt, poverty levels, or business failures. It also takes into account sudden drops in commodity prices, trade revenue, or foreign investment, and any collapse or devaluation of the national currency. The Economic Decline Indicator further considers the responses to economic conditions and their consequences, such as extreme social hardship imposed by economic austerity programs, or perceived increasing group inequalities. The Economic Decline Indicator is focused on the formal economy – as well as illicit trade, including the drug and human trafficking, and capital flight, or levels of corruption and illicit transactions such as money laundering or embezzlement.]"

The Indicator looks at whether there is widespread abuse of legal, political and social rights, including those of individuals, groups and institutions (e.g. harassment of the press, politicization of the judiciary, internal use of military for political ends, repression of political opponents). The Indicator also considers outbreaks of politically inspired (as opposed to criminal) violence perpetrated against civilians. It also looks at factors such as denial of due process consistent with international norms and practices for political prisoners or dissidents, and whether there is current or emerging authoritarian, dictatorial or military rule in which constitutional and democratic institutions and processes are suspended or manipulated.

Investments in facilities are the resources the project company commits to invest during the contract period either in new facilities or in expansion and modernization of existing facilities. Investments in government assets are the resources the project company spends on acquiring government assets such as state-owned enterprises, rights to provide services in a specific area, or the use of specific radio spectrums.

A specific delay could be measurable, but  the concept needs further specification. Note that a delay node occurs in NSC Election Delay CAG.  A human could infer from this that dely means election delay, but the system does not make inferences based on context. Note that there is a larger CAG likely formed by combining this CAG with others, and it  contains an ""election delay"" node and not a ""delay"" node.  Thus,  ambiguity and vagueness may have been reduced over the course of development. Also note that there is only a single indicator (""id"":""UAZ_VUAZ-8010"") whose dsiplay name and description that contain the word ""delay"": ""WDI: Delay in obtaining an electrical connection[days]""  This would be a reasonable match to the ""delay"" node concept taken out of context, but not if CAG context is taken into acount.
